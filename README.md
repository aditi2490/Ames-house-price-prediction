# Ames Housing Data - Housing Price Prediction 

In this project I have examined a comprehensive housing dataset from the city of Ames in Iowa, USA. People looking to buy houses want to get the best house possible given a budget. The goal of this project is to address some of these concerns, specifically:

1. Which features add the most value to a home ?
2. With the given a set of features, what is the expected sale price of a house?
3. With a budget in mind of the buyer, what kind of house would one be able to afford?

In order to answer these questions, I have applied linear regression models to the housing data in order to determine the features that are the most influential on the house price and included the ones that have the least effect. The performance of the models is evaluated using the R2 metric, using which we can observe how much the model is able to explain the variance in the dataset.

The entire project is split into three Jupyter notebooks: 
1. EDA and data cleaning, 
2. Preprocessing and feature engineering,
3. Model tuning and insights
